Computational Tests for Mathematical Solutions to the Riccati Coefficient Problem

This module implements rigorous mathematical strategies for proving global regularity
of 3D Navier-Stokes equations under vibrational regularization.

Modules:
    - DyadicAnalysis: Scale-dependent dyadic dissipation analysis
    - ParabolicCoercivity: Parabolic coercivity lemma and damping coefficients
    - EnergyMethods: Critical energy limit theorems and LÂ³ control
