# Brand Assets

This directory contains branding assets for the documentation site.

## Files

- **logo.svg**: Logo displayed in the navigation bar (currently a placeholder)
- **favicon.png**: Favicon for the website (to be added)

## Customization

To customize the branding:

1. **Replace logo.svg** with your own logo (SVG format recommended)
   - Recommended size: 200x200px
   - The logo should work well on both light and dark backgrounds

2. **Add favicon.png** 
   - Recommended size: 32x32px or 64x64px
   - PNG format
   - Should be simple and recognizable at small sizes

3. **Optional: Add og-default.png** for social media previews
   - Recommended size: 1200x630px
   - Used as fallback when specific page doesn't have an auto-generated card

## Note

The current logo.svg is a simple placeholder representing the 141Hz frequency theme. Feel free to replace it with your own design.
